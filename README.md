# idso-cursed

A CURSED deadfish compiler

## Usage

You'll need these installed on your local machine :
 - gcc

First, download the `idso-cursed.py` file contained in this repo and put them in a directory on your local machine

You can now use the compiler to compile a deadfish program :

`$ python3 idso-cursed.py df-program myprogram.df` The first argument is the name you want the executable to have, the second is the source file

And voila, you got yourself a binary executable out of your deadfish program that you can run like this :

`$ ./df-program`
